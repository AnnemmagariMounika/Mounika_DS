#Self-Introduction:

Hi, my name is Mounika Annemmagari, and I’ve been working as a Data Scientist for over a year. I’m passionate about using data to solve real business problems, and I specialize in areas like Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing (NLP), Generative AI, and Data Visualization.

In Generative AI, I have hands-on experience with models like GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) and diffusion models, focusing on generating creative content such as text, images, and video. I've worked on building chatbots, content generation tools, and other AI-powered solutions customised for specific business needs.

In Machine Learning, I’ve developed models that help companies make smarter decisions. For example, I worked on a project that predicted customer churn, meaning it could tell which customers were likely to leave, allowing businesses to take steps to keep them. I used tools like Random Forest and SVM to build these models.

When it comes to data visualization, I believe it’s important to present data in a way that everyone can understand. I’ve used tools like Seaborn and Matplotlib to create clear charts and graphs that explain complicated data in a simple way.

I’m also experienced in data cleaning and preprocessing, which means preparing raw data so it’s ready for analysis. This involves handling missing data, making sure everything is accurate, and getting the data in the right format for machine learning models.

At Aiml Labs Private Limited, I’ve had the chance to work on exciting projects and collaborate with great teams. I enjoy sharing my knowledge with others and learning from my colleagues to create solutions that really make a difference.

I’m always eager to learn new things and explore the latest trends in AI and machine learning, and I look forward to continuing to use these skills to help businesses make better decisions with their data.
